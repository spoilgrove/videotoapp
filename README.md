How/if you can/want send a video to someone but in different way/or privately  ?

Now you can send a video by inject that video within apk ! Let's go

1. Frist take a video and rename that to video.mp4
2. Take a image and rename that to icon ( e.g. wow.png --> icon.png )
3. Install apktool M ( if you want to change the apk name and icon )
4. Install mt manager ( for adding your video into the apk )
5. Now open the apktool M and go to the AppVideoViewer.apk
6. Just tap on the apk you will get some select option tap on quick edit
7. Now you can see a section called app name now set/edit a name what you want to call your apk
8. Top of the app name tap on the apk icon then select your own image you want give what will appear on the home screen
9. now you can see there now a new app named whatyougive_mod.apk or previous name_mod.apk ( don't upset for seeing the name and icon is not  change ok. now tap on previousname_mod.apk and install it. after install you can see all worked )
10. Now open the mt manager --> and select menu icon from top left corner ---> then Extract apk option and select your coustom apk what you just install --> then extract apk --> then locate
11. Now tap on apk and > select view
12. Now tap on assets > then delete the video.mp4 and select your video.mp4
13. For do press on vedio.mp4 and delete that then use right side and toogle and go to the your video.mp4 and press and click <- add make sure you have select auto sign
14. Now look at the bottom and click back on left side ( apk edit side )
15. Now delete the app from your phone home screen and click on the apk and click install  from mt manager ( you can think the apk showed name as yourappname_1.0.apk it's not matter ) just install
16. Boom all done



Add. . store all resource in one folder
Note : If you think that you can do all this staff with just apktool M without error then you are wrong brother. Yes you can make and add vedio to the apk but in installation process you will get a error by privacy protect this can change victims mind. But mt manager have a feature like auto sign that can hide the privacy protect massage ( it's work on my device ). If you want more or you are getting privacy protect error by using mt manager then you can use  android studio or apk editor ( pc version ) or apk easy tool just go any of them ( e.g. android studio ) and import the apk and decompile then save the file and close and rerun that tool ( e.g. android studio ) import the decompile files and rebuid/compile that now you just get a pure apk this one don't give you privacy protect error. ( You can use this if you want to build a apk which one giving you privacy protect error boom )
